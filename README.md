# SperasoftRoadmap
A few tasks from Sperasoft engineer roadmap

Tasks and Status:
Completed:
- **Core Redirects**: Use Core Redirects to rename a UPROPERTY in C++ that is used in blueprints without breaking them.
- **Scene Capture / Procedural Textures**: Create an enemy scanner or mini map. Draw a texture from an orthographic camera above the map, add contrast objects that are visible to that camera only and create a UI material to modify this texture to your artistic vision.
- **Slate**: Use Slate to create a separate window with arbitrary content. For example, the mini-map texture created before.

In progress:
- **Editor Extensions**: Create a Game Editor module and implement a tool for creating custom shapes using Dynamic Mesh Component.
